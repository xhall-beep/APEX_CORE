## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include documentation for public APIs
- Write unit tests for new functionality

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branches from main
2. Write descriptive commit messages
3. Submit pull requests for review
4. Ensure tests pass before merging

### Testing
#### Key Testing Practices
- Use Kotlin test framework with coroutines (`runTest`, `advanceUntilIdle`)
- Prefer Integration tests over Unit tests to reduce test maintenance overhead
- Write unit tests for core complex components
- Test YAML configurations and backward compatibility
- Implement fake objects (FakeDevice, FakeAi) for dependencies

#### UI Testing
- Use Compose UI testing framework
- Implement Robot Pattern for UI test organization
- Use behavior-driven testing style
- Include screenshot testing with Roborazzi
- Test UI interactions and state assertions

### Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Document significant changes
- Include examples in documentation
- Use clear and concise language
